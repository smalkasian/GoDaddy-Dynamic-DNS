# GoDaddy-Dynamic-DNS
 Dynamic DNS tool written in python for GoDaddy domains.

V1 is meant to be run from a task scheduler and won't consume unnecessary resources (cron or the like)

V2 is meant to run from terminal and will output the log to keep track of what's happening. Runs a while True loop so may 
consume resources on less powerful servers/machines.
